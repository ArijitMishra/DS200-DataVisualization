# DS200-DataVisualization
Data visuallization plots from data.gov.in for the assignment DS200 for the year 2022-2023

The data has been taken from Open government data (OGD) platform India. This dataset consists of the prison population details for the month of July in India. The dtaaset contains data from every prision in India. It h tabulates the number of convicted prisoners and the number of priosoners on trial, housed in the prison.
The scatter plot shows Under trial priosners(U) on x axis and the convicted prisoners (C) on y axis. As we can see. most of the data points are at the bottom left of the plot, showing less number of prisoners and only one prioner has more than 1000 prisoners in both these categories
In the box plot, for the under trial data distribution, we see a nice plot, with most of the data between q1 and q3. However, the box plot for the convicted data distribution is quite skewed, with many of the data points being outside of the q1 to q3 range.
The two different bar plots show us the number of prisoners under trial and convicted prisoners with respect to a single prison. As we can see, in both these categories, the Central prison, Bengaluru has the highest number of prisoners. The rest of the values are well below half of the number seen in the central prison.
